# Handwritten number recognizer with MNIST dataset

*This is a common exercise for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), featuring the MNIST Dataset. It allows us to recognize handwritten digits, from 0 to 9.

*PyTorch

*Low generalizability

*Change the line "img = Image.open('2.png')" accordingly

*There are 2 parts (comment out docstring accordingly)...- 
1. Model training
2. Model application
